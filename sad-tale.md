Ned should've never told Cersei about the secret he knew about her sons.
That was his biggest mistake. If only he would've kept it to himself.
He should've just done straight to the King and told him what he knew.
Then Cersei would've been the one who was beheaded. But if this happened,
Game of Thrones wouldn't be such a great show.
